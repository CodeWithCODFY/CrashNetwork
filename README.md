## 🎨 Theming
This project uses **CSS variables** so you can quickly change the entire color theme.  
Default is Red. See in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
  --color-bg: #020301;
  --color-text: #ffffff;
  --color-primary: #ff1616;
  --color-primary-dark: #ae2727;
  --color-accent: #5865F2;
  ...
}
```
Change these variables to instantly update the site’s look.

## 🌍 Live Player Count
The server IP is fetched via:

  ```js
  const serverIP = "[your_ip]"; // Replace with your IP
  ```
- Displays current online players

- Shows Server Offline or Error Loading when unreachable

- Updates on page load
